<br>
<h3 id="1"><a href="#top">SAT Prep</a></h3>
<p>The Digital SAT (DSAT) is a pivotal step in your academic journey, influencing college admissions and scholarship opportunities.
<br><br>
While many students may be familiar with the material, the unique format and question styles of the DSAT often catch even the best-prepared off guard.
<br><br>
My course is designed to bridge that gap, giving you not just the knowledge but also the test-taking experience to excel.
<br><br>
Together, we'll address common pitfalls like careless mistakes, unexpected question phrasing, and the pressure of a timed environment.</p>
<br>
<h4>A Key Tip for Success:</h4>
<p>One of the most effective tools for improving your performance is a pocket-sized notepad.
<br><br>  
During the course, I encourage students to jot down every mistakes they make; whether it's a miscalculation, a misinterpretation of the question, or simply forgetting a key concept.
<br><br>
This notepad serves as a quick reference guide to track what you've learned, highlight areas of improvement, and remind you to avoid repeating the same errors.
<br><br>
Reviewing this notepad regularly helps solidify your progress and ensures you're continually refining your approach.</p>

<h4>What We'll Cover:</h4>
<p>My comprehensive DSAT preparation course focuses on the core areas assessed in the exam, ensuring you are fully prepared for every challenge:
<br>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Pre-Algebra</strong>: Strengthen your foundation with number properties, basic operation, and working with exponential equations.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Problem Solving and Data Analysis</strong>: Master interpreting graphs, analyzing trends, and solving real-world math problems.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Algebra</strong>: Build confidence in solving linear equations, inequalities, and system of equations.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Advance Math</strong>: Tackle quadratic equation, composite functions, transformation, and higher-level algebraic concept.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Geometry and Trigonometry</strong>: Focus on essential concepts like angles and triangle, volume and density, circles, and trigonometry ratios crucial for DSAT success.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h4>Unlock the Joy of Learning Math</h4>
<p>With years of experience and a deep passion for teaching, I've come to understand the challenges students face when tackling math.
<br><br>
One key observation is that many textbooks fall short in explaining foundational concepts in way that truly resonate with students. 
<br><br>
These gaps can make math feel intimidating and difficult to grasp, leading to frustration and even fear.

<h3 id="5"><a href="#top">About Me</a></h3>
<p>Born in Taichung City, Taiwan, I, Kuan-Yuan <em>also known as Kevin</em> Huang, grew up in Guam, where my family operated a long-liner fishing and international exporting business.<br><br>
This unique upbringing instilled in me a strong work ethic and a curiosity for understanding the world through numbers.<br><br>
My journey eventually brought me to Washington, where I pursued a Physics degree at the University of Washington Seattle campus while enlisted in the United States Army Reserve.<br><br>
Serving eight fulfilling years in the military not only shape my discipline and leadership skills but also deepened my appreciation for education as a tool for growth and opportunity.
</p>
<p>After my military service, I took on the challenge of managing my family's business in Palau and Yap, balancing leadership responsibilities with my growing passion for teaching math.<br><br>
It was during this time I discovered how much joy I found in helping others understand complex concepts and overcome learning obstacles. <br><br>
Whether solving a challenging problem or guiding someone to a "lightbulb moment," I realized that teaching math was not just a profession for me, it was a calling.</p>
<p>Now, back in the mainland US, I am thrilled to embark on this new chapter of teaching while raising my family with my loving wife and two wonderful children.<br><br>
My goal is to give students the tools and mindset they need to succeed in math and beyond--skills I wish I had been taught at an earlier age.<br><br>
Teaching is more than sharing knowledge for me; it's about empowering the next generation to embrace challenges and achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you and being part of your journey to math mastery!</p>
