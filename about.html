<p>Born in Taichung City, Taiwan, I, Kuan-Yuan <em>also known as Kevin</em> Huang, grew up in Guam, where my family operated a long-liner fishing and international exporting business.<br><br>
This unique upbringing instilled in me a strong work ethic and a curiosity for understanding the world through numbers.<br><br>
My journey eventually brought me to Washington, where I pursued a Physics degree at the University of Washington Seattle campus while enlisted in the United States Army Reserve.<br><br>
Serving eight fulfilling years in the military not only shape my discipline and leadership skills but also deepened my appreciation for education as a tool for growth and opportunity.
</p>
<p>After my military service, I took on the challenge of managing my family's business in Palau and Yap, balancing leadership responsibilities with my growing passion for teaching math.<br><br>
It was during this time I discovered how much joy I found in helping others understand complex concepts and overcome learning obstacles. <br><br>
Whether solving a challenging problem or guiding someone to a "lightbulb moment," I realized that teaching math was not just a profession for me, it was a calling.</p>
<p>Now, back in the mainland US, I am thrilled to embark on this new chapter of teaching while raising my family with my loving wife and two wonderful children.<br><br>
My goal is to give students the tools and mindset they need to succeed in math and beyond--skills I wish I had been taught at an earlier age.<br><br>
Teaching is more than sharing knowledge for me; it's about empowering the next generation to embrace challenges and achieve their full potential.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you and being part of your journey to math mastery!</p>
